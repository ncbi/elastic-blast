# ElasticBLAST

The National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI), part of the National Library of
Medicine, is making the source code for ElasticBLAST available on GitHub as an
Open Distribution to allow the user community to easily obtain and examine
that code.  GitHub also provides a means for users to report issues and
suggest modifications through pull requests. 


The NCBI will use internal source code control as the repository of record and
push regular releases of the ElasticBLAST
source code to GitHub.  The BLAST developers will work to ensure that
ElasticBLAST continues to function in 
changing environments and, when possible, integrate user feedback into
ElasticBLAST.  Owing to resource constraints, 
they cannot absolutely commit to act on all issue reports, except critical
security vulnerabilities.
